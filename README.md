## What is Blue Waters

BlueWaters is a Node Red Application that will provide user(community users, water analysts) with insights and information on monitoring water sources.
Our water sources lack basic protections
from such, this vulnerability renders them susceptible to pollution and contamination.
Improvement of water quality is a pivotal part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs),
data collection and sharing has been centred as an important step for reaching water quality targets.
Access to reliable water quality data is critical for increased understanding of water issues and for
developing efficient management strategies of major water sources in Botswana. To support
scientific progression in Botswana and an efficient hub for systematic data collection, utilization
& monitoring of water quality in major water sources (dams & rivers) is very pivotal as such
monitoring systems need to be adopted that will give timely and up to date information regarding
water sources in Botswana.
